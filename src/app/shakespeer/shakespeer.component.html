        We designed <i>ShakesPeer</i>, an interactive tool that visualizes interactions between characters in Shakespeareâ€™s plays. 
        By translating play dialogue into simple bar charts and graphs, users can get a quick, high-level overview of the play's social organization, as well as identify characters' friends and enemies at different points in the story.

    <p>This tool was implemented as part of an information visualization course at UBC (CPSC 547). The project milestones and final report can be viewed <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/547-19/projects.html">here</a>.</p>
