        <p>I am a Master's student studying Computer Science at the University of British Columbia and a member of the <a href="https://dfp.ubc.ca/">Designing for People</a> intitative. I have a wide range of experiences, including UX research, healthcare research, and visual design. For my thesis, I am working with Professor <a href="http://dwyoon.com/">Dongwook Yoon</a> to design assistive technology for the elderly.</p>
        <p>During my breaks and free time, I like to exercise my creative side. I love to draw and read, and <i>occasionally</i> enjoy a cold pint of craft beer.</p>
